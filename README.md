# Number_Counter

Write a program that asks the user to input some parameters used to generate a range of
numbers. The user should be prompted to enter a start value, an end value and a step value.
The only required value is the end value; if the user hits enter without providing a number
for the start or step, then the value 0 is used as the start and the default value of 1 is used
for the step.

If the user enters an incorrect value (i.e. a string) or does not provide a required value, print a
message indicating that the value is incorrect and prompt them again until a correct value is
input. Once the values have been entered by the user, print the range to the screen.
